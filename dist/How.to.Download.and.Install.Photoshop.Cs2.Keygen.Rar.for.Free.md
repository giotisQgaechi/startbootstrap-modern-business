## Tips and Warnings on Using Keygens

- Keygens are not illegal by themselves, but they can be used for illegal purposes. Make sure you only use keygens for software that are legally available for free, such as Photoshop Cs2[^4^]. Do not use keygens for software that are still protected by copyright or require payment.
- Keygens can also carry viruses or malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Make sure you scan any keygen file 0f148eb4a0
