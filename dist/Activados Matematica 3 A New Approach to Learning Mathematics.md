The book covers the following topics: numbers and operations, algebraic expressions and equations, functions and graphs, geometry and measurement, statistics and probability. Each chapter includes the following sections and features:
 
- Apertura: each chapter begins with an activity that presents relevant and engaging information to recall the contents of the topic. It also shows the objectives and subtopics that will be developed in the chapter.
- Identificacion: a learning situation that introduces the topic of the chapter through interesting problems that show the mathematics in reality.
- Infotactivados: it provides definitions, explanations, basic procedures and examples of each concept that facilitate the comprehension.
- Comprension activada: it includes questions that allow to check the understanding of the theory and to apply it to different contexts.
- Trabajos en equipo: it proposes collaborative activities that encourage communication, argumentation and reflection among students.
- Actividades: for each subtopic, it offers different types of activities that are classified according to their level of difficulty: BASICA (basic), INTERMEDIA (intermediate) and AVANZADA (advanced). The activities involve problem situations with increasing levels of complexity and challenge.
- Autoevaluacion: it provides self-assessment activities for each subtopic so that the student can evaluate their own learning progress.
- TICactivados: in this section, it gives the possibility of working on a concept of the topic using technological tools such as spreadsheets, programs and educational software that allow to represent graphically, simulate situations, manipulate functions, etc.

The book also comes with a PDF version that can be downloaded from the publisher's website. The PDF version has 145 pages and contains all the contents and activities of the printed book. It also has interactive features such as links, animations, videos and exercises that enhance the learning experience.
 
Activados Matematica 3 is a new proposal that makes mathematics more accessible, meaningful and fun for students. It helps them to develop their mathematical thinking skills, their creativity and their problem-solving abilities. It also prepares them for further studies and challenges in mathematics and other disciplines.
  
One of the advantages of Activados Matematica 3 is that it follows a constructivist approach to teaching and learning mathematics. This means that it encourages students to build their own knowledge based on their previous experiences, their interactions with others and their exploration of the mathematical objects. It also promotes the use of multiple representations and strategies to solve problems and to communicate mathematical ideas.
 
Another benefit of Activados Matematica 3 is that it aligns with the national curriculum and the standards of mathematical competence for secondary education in Argentina. It covers all the topics and objectives that are expected for the third year of secondary education. It also develops the four dimensions of mathematical competence: conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic thinking and communicative ability.
 
Finally, Activados Matematica 3 is a book that supports the work of teachers and students in the classroom. It provides clear and detailed explanations, examples and solutions for each concept and activity. It also offers suggestions, tips and additional resources for teachers to enrich their teaching practice and to adapt the activities to the needs and interests of their students.
